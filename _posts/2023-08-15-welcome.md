Welcome to my personal website! I recently decided to start experimenting with self-hosting and build my first home server. I build this website to share my findings and experiences with setting up my first home server, and I'll continue to post about the projects I'm working on.

## Choosing the platform

Choosing the platform to make this website hasn't gone so smoothly. So here is a short recap.

### Vanilla

Because I love to code, and I'm not afraid of doing some front-end designing work I started completely from scratch and build my website with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And while it was fun to do I quickly realized that it was way too much work. I kept changing the CSS code because there was always this one little thing that wasn't exactly right. Because I wanted this site to be a blog first, and I did not want to fiddle with everything else all the time I decided that this was not the way to go.

### WordPress

Do I have to explain this choice? WordPress is a very well-known blogging platform, so I thought, why not give it a go? I found a [Turnkey WordPress Linux container](https://www.turnkeylinux.org/wordpress) in Proxmox which made installing WordPress really easy. I spun up the container and started experimenting with the WordPress dashboard. After spending a whole evening on hunt for a good theme I settled on one that was the closest to what I wanted. I tried changing the looks of it a little like changing the colours, but I soon discovered that a lot of options where behind a pay-wall. I tried to make the best of it, but the frustrations piled up and I wasn't happy with the end result.

### Jekyll themes

That's when I discovered the really beautiful Jekyll theme [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) that was nearly exactly what I was looking for. I stumbled upon it when watching a YouTube video from [Techno Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnoTim) and opening his [documentation site](https://technotim.live/). I decided that this was the way to go. Because I was already taking notes in Markdown and working with git and GitHub, so it was really easy to get started.

So that's where I am now and I'm really happy with how everything is looking.

## Development environment

I made a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/QAGovaerts/QAGovaerts.github.io) for this website from the [Chirpy starter template](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) and cloned it to my local machine. I followed the [getting started guide](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started) from Chirpy but I had some trouble getting the right version of Ruby installed on my system, so I went with the Docker container solution. I wished I had tried that sooner because since I had Docker already installed it was just a matter of spinning up the container and I had a working site to test with.

## First blog post

Techno Tim has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q) about this Jekyll theme so I watched it in case I overlooked something, but everything was really straight-forward. I changed the `_config.yml` file and personalized my site. Then I only had to write an [about me](/about) section, write this very first blog post and my personal site was born.

Have fun exploring and reading my next posts!
