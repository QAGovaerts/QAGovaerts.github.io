Hello, I'm Quinten Alexander Govaerts, a 22-year-old student doing a Master's degree in ICT Security and Networks at KU Leuven in Belgium. Welcome to my website!

I've had a fascination with technology and electronics since I was a young boy. For me, it all started with Scratch and LEGO Mindstorms. This led me to explore building projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. More recently, the world of software, computer networks and security have expanded my interests. I'm particularly fascinated by the complex layers that make up the internet and like to keep up to date with the latest developments in privacy and security.

I recently had the opportunity to work on a team project to develop a dashboard for an autonomous drone. This dashboard displayed a live video feed and telemetry from the drone during flight. As I had to make sure that all the components on the drone could communicate with each other, this project gave me my first hands-on experience with networking skills and sparked my interest in computer networking.

Outside of my studies, I find joy in the world of amateur theatre. After five years of acting in my high school's theatre group, I joined VTK Revue, the amateur theatre group of the "burgies" (that's what we call each other as civil engineering students here at KUL). Every year we put on a comedy show that takes a humorous look at student life and pokes fun at our professors. After directing the plays "Cosine Royale" and "Riemannji, Welcome to Toledo", I am now continuing my love for theatre as an actor and scriptwriter.

Because my online privacy is becoming increasingly important to me, I have recently decided to start experimenting with self-hosting. I started this website to document my findings and the problems I encountered while setting up my first home server. I'll continue to post about the projects I'm working on, so feel free to explore my projects and insights.

Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any questions or just want to get in touch, please don't hesitate to contact me!
